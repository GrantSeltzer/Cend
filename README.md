# Cend

Cend is a series of very simple scripts to make it extremly easy for linux users to transfer files to remote servers or computers. 

When using cend, the user can set up 'profiles' (using the cendProfile command). These profiles contain the ipaddress of the remote computer, as well as the users username, password and desired path to the transfer directory. After the profile is setup, you would never have to enter this information again. Simply run 'cend' in the command line, choose what file you would like to transfer, the desired profile and you're done! The advantage is not having to memorize ip address's, and passwords.

This was created to make my own life easier for transfering programming assignments or notes from my mobile netbook to both my schools server and my desktop at my apartment.

I know that there is a huge amount of room for improvement and it will most likely be constantly updated. I'm very receptive to feedback, so if you see something I can do better, please let me know!
