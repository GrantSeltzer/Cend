A series of simple scripts for creating profiles to make it simple to scp files to remote servers or desktops

This was created to make my own life easier for transfering programming assignments or notes from my mobile netbook to both the school server and my desktop at my apartment. 

I know there are a lot of things that can be improved on, and will most likely be constantly be updated. I'm very receptive to feedback, so if you see something I can do better, please let me know!
